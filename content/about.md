# About website
This website expands on topics from the  [@RoadSideMaker](https://youtube.com/@roadsidemaker) YouTube channel
 It servs as a reference guide for published videos.
Additionally the aim is to grow a knowledge base for makers interested in 3D printing and CAD modeling.
# About me
My name is Alex, I am IT professional by trade. But I have a lot of hobbies (too many to be honest).
One thing led to another:
- Analog photography led to acquiring a 3D printer (Ender 3 v2 and Bambu P1S later)
- 3D printing led to modeling parts
- Modeling parts led to many questions
- Answers to some questions were not straight forward and lead to research
- Research accumulated and led to the creation of YouTube channel where I publish answers that were hard to come by
